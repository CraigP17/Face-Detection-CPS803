Unzip the archive for images


## Code Structure
Our code runs of main.py, each model inherits from the Model class (model.py) and every image is processed as an Image class (image.py)
util.py and preprocess.py deal with image and model metrics related functions
We also have a demo application that runs on webcam as demo_webcam.py
